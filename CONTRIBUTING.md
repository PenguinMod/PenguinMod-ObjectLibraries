## General
To add your own sprite, costume, sound or content to PenguinMod:
- All content must be **Public Domain** or **MIT Licensed** (No Exceptions!)
- All costumes must be .svg or .png format
- All sounds must be .mp3 format
- All content must not have any special restrictions (ie: only Steamboat Willie is public domain but not recent versions of Mickey)
- All content must be appropriate for ages 10+ (exceptions: **audio** of attacking, blood or weaponry)

When you have added one of these, make sure to list what the name of the item(s) are in your Pull Request.

Important notes:
- You will only be credited on the [Credits page](https://studio.penguinmod.com/credits.html) in a list of people, similar to extension submitters
- Extremely low quality content likely will not appear on PenguinMod, stuff like a poorly drawn stickman or kids reading out voice lines over their phone's microphone.

## Costumes
Guidelines & notes for costumes are as follows:
- SFW (Safe for Work) content ONLY. Suggestive/sexual content is not tolerated.
- AI-Generated content will be ignored and closed. You aren't a chef if you only know how to microwave store-bought meals.
- Usually you shouldn't make fully original & detailed characters, it's instead recommended to create stuff like generic objects or symbols like the current library.
  - This will allow for people to use your work in all types of projects, examples being buttons or objects like balloons and tools.

## Sounds
Guidelines & notes for sounds are as follows:
- Sounds ripped directly from other games/media are not allowed.
- Do not post sounds from/resembling 18+ content, however bloody/gorey sounds are allowed.
- AI-Generated content will be ignored and closed. You aren't a chef if you only know how to microwave store-bought meals.
- For music, a lot of old Public Domain music may be problematic since existing performances & recordings of the music *can* be copyrighted.
- Music with lyrics will be accepted, but some people may prefer instrumental songs for games.

## Emojis
Please follow these guidelines for emojis:
- No emojis ripped/traced directly from another emoji set (Twemoji, Apple emojis, etc)
- Emoji file names must be lowercase, only use characters a-z, and similar emojis should start with the same name. (examples: alien, alienhappy, aliengreen, aliengreenhappy)
- Avoid looking out of place from other emojis (exceptions: badges from the website, or reused assets from elsewhere on PenguinMod)
- Use a 256x256 canvas with a transparent background (unless the emoji entails otherwise)
- Avoid anti-aliasing (unless you need it for zooming/resizing, or messing with rotation/perspective)
- Important features such as eyes or mouth should be at least 4 pixels large (usually this is the outline/border)
- Important features should be visible at the same resolution the project description displays them

We will introduce more styles of emojis at a later date.
